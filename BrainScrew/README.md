## Overview

Brain Screw is a game which plays on the Stroop Effect. The Stroop Effect is simple - given a series of color words which are painted a different color, the user will have a slightly harder time naming the color of the word itself, and end up reading out the word.

## Mock-up and Simulation

The design of the app and simulation can be viewed at the following link:<br>
